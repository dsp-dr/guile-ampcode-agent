A Guile implementation of an AI agent following the [ampcode.com](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) pattern for tool-based interactions with multiple LLM backends.

![Demo](demo-working.gif)

This project demonstrates how to build a functional AI agent in Scheme that can interact with the Anthropic Claude API and execute tools based on natural language requests.

## Features

- Clean modular architecture using Guile's module system
- Tool registration and execution framework
- Conversation state management
- Support for Claude's tool-calling capabilities
- Example tools included (weather, calculator)
- REPL-based interaction

## Architecture

The agent follows the pattern described at https://ghuntley.com/agent/ and consists of:

- **Client Module**: Handles communication with Anthropic's API
- **Message Module**: Defines message types and serialization
- **Tools Module**: Tool registry and execution framework
- **Agent Module**: Main conversation loop and orchestration

## Prerequisites

- Guile 3.0 or later
- An Anthropic API key

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dsp-dr/guile-ampcode-agent.git
cd guile-ampcode-agent

# Build (optional - compiles to bytecode)
gmake

# Install system-wide (optional)
sudo gmake install
```

## Usage

### Set your API key

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Run the agent

```bash
./guile-agent
```

Or with options:

```bash
./guile-agent -k "your-api-key" -m "claude-3-opus-20240229"
```

### Available commands

- Type any message to interact with Claude
- Type `quit` to exit
- Claude can use the registered tools (weather, calculator) automatically

### Example interaction

```
> What's the weather in San Francisco?
Assistant: I'll check the weather in San Francisco for you.
The weather in San Francisco, CA is currently 22° C with partly cloudy skies.

> Calculate 15% tip on a $48.50 bill
Assistant: I'll calculate 15% tip on $48.50 for you.
Result: 7.275
A 15% tip on a $48.50 bill would be $7.28 (rounded up).
```

## Extending with New Tools

To add a new tool, create a module in `src/tools/` following this pattern:

```scheme
(define-module (tools mytool)
  #:use-module (agent tools)
  #:export (my-tool))

(define my-tool
  (make-tool
   "tool_name"
   "Tool description for Claude"
   '((type . "object")
     (properties . ((param . ((type . "string")))))
     (required . #("param")))
   (lambda (input)
     ;; Tool implementation
     "Tool result")))
```

Then register it in the main executable:

```scheme
(register-tool! tools my-tool)
```

## Configuration

The agent can be configured through:

- Environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Command-line options (-k, -m)
- Code modifications for custom tools

## Development

```bash
# Run tests (when available)
gmake test

# Clean compiled files
gmake clean

# Get help on make targets
gmake help
```
